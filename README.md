# IENG 331 Final Project

## Project Overview

Each team is provided **one unique dataset**. You already have a set of starter questions with the dataset. The core of the final project is to **answer those baseline questions _and_ design your own extension** that demonstrates initiative, creativity, and technical depth.

### Required Baseline

- Clean the data & document your assumptions.
- Answer **all** instructor questions using Polars queries.
- Communicate answers with at least 3 substantive Plotly figures.

### Extension

Propose and answer two in-depth analysis questions that go beyond the baseline instructor questions. These questions should:

1. **Demonstrate deeper insights** into the data, revealing patterns or relationships not covered in the baseline.
2. **Incorporate substantial data manipulation and visualization**, clearly showing your analytical thought process and findings.

## Deliverables

Remember that the due date is Monday, April 28 @ 11:59 PM. Every change after the due date will result in drop of 10 points.

1. **Code Repository**: Either a GitHub repo or OneDrive folder with all the contents of your project. Share the link with me at `ozan.ozbeker@mail.wvu.edu` with full edit control.
2. **Presentation**: Marimo slides or PowerPoint showcasing your results & findings, not talking about the code or project itself.
3. **Report**: Word document explaining your coding process, any challenges your team might have had (a lot of nulls, weird dates etc.).

## Grading Rubric

| Category                         | Points | Criteria                                                                               |
|----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Baseline analysis                | 20     | All instructor questions answered correctly & efficiently in Polars                    |
| Creative/extended analysis       | 20     | Clear problem statement, justified methods, and insightful conclusions beyond baseline |
| Data wrangling & reproducibility | 10     | Clean, well-commented Polars pipeline; uses uv appropriately                           |
| Code quality & documentation     | 15     | Code should run without any of my intervention to reproduce your same results          |
| Visualization excellence         | 15     | Plotly figures follow best practices (titles, labels, color-blind safe, legends);      |
| PowerPoint/Report                | 5      | Polished, concise writing; hyperlinks & citations as needed                            |
| Presentation delivery            | 10     | <= 10 min; engaging delivery; slide design cohesive                                    |
| Q-and-A mastery                  | 5      | Team answers audience/instructor questions accurately & collaboratively                |

## Logistics & Tips

- **Presentation Medium**; using marimo's slides feature might be easier than using PowerPoint, you can learn more about it [here](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/apps/#slides-layout). But you are welcome to use PowerPoint if you like.
- **Time Management**: Minimum presentation time is 5 minutes, reserve 2 minutes for Q&A after.
- **Academic Integrity**: Clearly cite all external code or documentation sources (Polars & Plotly docs only). No LLMs or AI-generated content allowed; violations result in a grade of zero.

Much of this project is vague on purpose, you will never get exactly clear instructions in real-life. Do your best and ask me questions where appropriate about logic, but don't come to me with help trying to debug your programs. Read the documentation.
